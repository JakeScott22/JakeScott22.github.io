    <h2>What is music?</h2>
    <p>Music can be interpreted in many different ways. Music can make you feel happy, sad, angry, any kind of emotion. It is able to get your adrenaline rushing or it can calm, you down. Music is used as a device to output emotions, like when your feeling angry, you would most likely listen to rock music.</p>
    <p>To me music is a extremely powerful thing, I use it to escape reality and think about my past, present and future. Music has helped me bond with friends over the years, and is a very powerful thing in my life, whether it's rock or jazz or hip-hop.</p>
