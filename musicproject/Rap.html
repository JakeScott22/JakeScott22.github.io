    <h2>Father of Rap</h2>
    <p>Rap music was created in the 1970's, one of the first rappers was a rapper who went under the name <a href="http://www.oldschoolhiphop.com/artists/deejays/kooldjherc.html">Dj Kool Herc</a>, a Jamaican Immigrant who lived in the Bronx. His full name was Clive Campbell, and had a father, mother, and sister.Herc is also called the father of hip-hop as well as the father of rap. Herc began rapping when the hip hop area came in, he began rapping at birthday parties, but soon not only him, but the whole genre of music began to rise. He is still alive at the age of 62, happily retired </p>
    <p>Rapping is all about a flow, you have to be able to have your words coside with each other in a rhythmic fasion. A highly impressive and interesting version of rapping is called free-stylingg, this is when you come up with the words and sentences in the heat of the moment. Of course rapping is also rehearsed and carefully written with impressive metophorical lines.</p>
