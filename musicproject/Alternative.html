    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>Alternative music is my personal favorite type of music. To be more specific, it's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock">Alternative rock.</a> This influencial music was created around the 1980's, the term  alternative was made to describe punk-rock inspired bands on independent record labels that did not fit into mainstream genres. Defining music as Alternative is difficult because they tend to have elements of other music such as jazz and rap.</p>
    <p>Alternative rock has since evolved rapidily and many bands create alternative music, some even transition from rock to alternative. Some bands such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_Out_Boy">Fall Out Boy</a> Panic! at the Disc, the Wombats, and Walk the Moon are a few of the bands. For research, I went to a Fall Out Boy concert. Many people seemed happy and highly energetic when the band came out on the stage. During songs people were jumping, yelling, raising their hands up, and much more, for the full two hours. Because of the peoples high energy, I concluded that Alternative music is to make peoples adrenaline rush and to party in general.</p>
