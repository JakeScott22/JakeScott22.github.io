    <h2>Inventors of Rock</h2>
    <p>Unlike rap, Rock and Roll had many creators, this includes people like Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddly and more! Rock is a popular genre of music that originated in the 1940's and early 1950's. It was inspired by African American music styles such as gospel and jazz. In the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxaphone were the leading instrument. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars a double bass or string bass, and a drum kit.</p>
